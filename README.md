# Example for Data Oriented Programming in Java

This repo contain source code for my talk "Algebraic Data Types + Pattern Matching = Elegant and readable Java code"

This program solves a [cryptarithmetic puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verbal_arithmetic): SEND + MORE = MONEY

The talk shows how you can write readable, understandable code with Data Oriented Programming in Java using records, sealed types and pattern matching features.
